# Workshop 01 – JavaScript Basics

## About this workshop
This workshop is an introduction to JavaScript and how it works in a web browser together with HTML.  
The exercises are done using a single HTML file and the browser’s Developer Tools, especially the Console.

The workshop focuses on learning by doing: trying out code, modifying it, making mistakes and understanding how JavaScript behaves in different situations.


## What this workshop includes
During the workshop, the following topics are explored:

- How JavaScript is added to an HTML file and executed in the browser
- Using the browser Console to test code and see results immediately
- Different ways to output data in JavaScript:
  - `console.log()`
  - `alert()`
  - `document.write()`
- Creating and using variables
- Writing conditional logic with `if / else if / else`
- Using loops to repeat actions
- Creating and calling functions
- Working with objects and their properties
- Using arrays that contain multiple objects
- Finding and fixing simple errors with Developer Tools

## How the workshop works
The workshop is built around small, clear exercises that can be tested directly in the browser.  
Instead of only reading code, the student is encouraged to actively change values, add new conditions and experiment with different solutions.

The Console plays an important role, as it allows quick testing and helps with understanding what the code is actually doing behind the scenes.

## What I learned
By completing this workshop, I gained a better understanding of how JavaScript works in practice, not just in theory.  
I learned how to read simple JavaScript code, modify it and see the results immediately in the browser.

The workshop also helped me feel more comfortable using the Console and debugging small issues on my own.


## Tools used
- HTML
